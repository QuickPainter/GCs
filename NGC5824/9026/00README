Guidelines for Chandra Science Publications
===========================================

    * Acknowledgment of the Use of Chandra
        o Funding
        o Data
        o Software
    * Linking Data and Publications
    * Chandra-Related PhD Theses
    * Chandra-Discovered Source Naming Convention



Acknowledgment of the Use of Chandra
------------------------------------

Funding

All publications of material based on or developed under a Chandra
Award must carry an acknowledgment of the Chandra Program as below,
incorporating the relevant Chandra Award Number. Such numbers usually
begin with GO, AR, TM or DD.

"Support for this work was provided by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration through Chandra Award Number ______ issued by the
Chandra X-ray Observatory Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory for and on behalf of the National
Aeronautics Space Administration under contract NAS8-03060."

All releases of photographic or illustrative data products should
include the following acknowledgment on the credit line:

"Photograph [or illustration, figure, etc.] courtesy of the Chandra
X-ray Observatory Center, which is operated by the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory on behalf of NASA, and [the Principal
Investigator's Institution]."

(Text reproduced from the Chandra Grants Terms and Conditions, Section XV)


Data

Authors of publications which use Chandra data (whether new or
archived) are asked to include an acknowledgement similar to the
following:

The scientific results reported in this article are based [if
applicable: in part or to a significant degree] on observations made
by the Chandra X-ray Observatory [for articles by the PI team], data
obtained from the Chandra Data Archive [for articles based on archival
data], observations made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory and
published previously in cited articles [for articles based on
published results].

Please also include a list of the ObsIDs and/or DOIs
for the data reported in your manuscript to ensure that archive users
can easily find and cite your results (see Linking Data section
below).


Software

Please acknowledge in the acknowledgment section of any resulting
publications use of CXC software. This will help greatly to keep track
of software usage, etc.

As an example, the following language is suggested (to be adapted as
applicable, of course):
"This research has made use of software provided by the Chandra X-ray
Center (CXC) in the application packages CIAO, ChIPS, and Sherpa."



Linking Data and Publications
-----------------------------

The Chandra archive is at the forefront of efforts to ensure that
archived data and any publications that report on that data are
directly linked. This information is crucial for data mining tools and
research aids that exploit the combined information of observations
and their publication. To ensure that your publications are clearly
available for archive users, please be sure to list the actual ObsIds
or DOIs in your manuscript.

Benefits of including this information:
    * archive users will have easy access to published analysis of the
      data in which they are interested 
    * articles with embedded data links receive a larger number of
      citations
    * enables archive searches for Chandra related papers (CRP) by PI,
      ObsId e.g., for the Previous Chandra Programs section of your
      Chandra proposals 
    * allows scientists (e.g. proposal reviewers) to seek information
      on a person's CRPs
    * enhances utility of combined data archive/publication research
      tools, like http://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cda/bibliography
    * facilitates an accurate count of all CRPs see
      http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/bibstats/bibstats.html

To find and/or report unlisted CRPs:

    * are all your CRPs included in the bibliography?
        o check at: http://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cda/bibliography or
        o search in ADS for your CRPs (check Chandra under Select
          References In:)
    * inform CXC of your unlisted CRPs: email bibcodes for your
      missing CRPs to Chandra Data Archive (arcops@cfa.harvard.edu)

New Publications that include Chandra data should include:

    * DOIs; for details on How-to, see:
      http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/datasetid.html 
    * grant numbers, e.g., CXC grant numbers beginning with GO, AR,
      TM, or DD. This is especially important for papers associated
      with archive and theory grants, since it is the only way these
      papers can be linked
    * facility keywords: "CXO" for Chandra; for usage, see:
      http://aas.org/journals/aastex/facilities



Chandra-Related PhD Theses
--------------------------

We are collecting information about student involvement with Chandra
science so that we have a quantitative estimate of this part of the
program. If you have been PI on a Chandra program that was analyzed as
part of a PhD thesis, or if your own thesis involved Chandra-related
research, please check to make sure that it has been recognized and
counted.

If you or someone you know of has completed a PhD thesis with a
substantial Chandra component that is *not* already listed in ADS or
at http://cxc.harvard.edu/cdo/phd_papers.html please let us know at
cxchelp@head.cfa.harvard.edu, providing as much information as you
have: author name, title, institution, year, advisor name, and
abstract and/or a link to the thesis.

Chandra-related Theses should also be retrievable from the ADS search
page http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html as follows:

   1. In the 'Filters' section of the page, in the box called
      "Select/deselect publications:", type in "PhDT"
   2. Farther down in the Filters section, under "Select References
      In:", select "All of the following (AND):" and then check the
      Chandra box
   3. Press the "Send Query" button, and look for the thesis of
      interest in the results



Chandra-Discovered Source Naming Convention
-------------------------------------------

The IAU Clearing House has approved the use of three acronyms for use
in designation of sources found with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

    * CXO (Chandra X-ray Observatory) is reserved for designating
      sources from Chandra X-ray Center projects of an institutional
      nature 
    * CXOAA, CXOAAA, and CXOAAAA (where "AA", "AAA", and "AAAA" are to
      be replaced by characters chosen by the author) are available
      for comprehensive source lists obtained from Chandra
      observations and made by individuals who pre-register the
      acronym using the IAU form at http:
      //cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/DicForm where they indicate the
      meaning of the appended 'A' characters, which are usually the
      initials of the author(s) 
    * CXOU, where 'U' means "unregistered", may be used for the
      occasional sources found/published by individuals using Chandra
      X-ray Observatory data
      Sample full name (unregistered):

          CXOU Jhhmmss.s+ddmmss (e.g. CXOU J123456.7+765432) 

      J indicates J2000 coordinates
      The coordinates should be truncated and are then accurate to
      1.5", 1" for RA, Dec respectively 

Please Note:
The coordinate information in source names is obtained by truncating
the coordinate values. That means, for instance, that, in a catalog
using acronym CXOXYZ and the same number of digits as CXOU, the source
with coordinates:

    RA = 12h 34m 56.789s, Dec = 12d 34' 56.789" 

will have the name:

    CXOXYZ J123456.7+123456 

This is a universal rule that applies to all source acronyms
registered with the IAU Clearing House.
